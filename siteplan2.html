            <img  src="http://cit230.darr.org/images/site_map.png" alt="Site Map"/>
          <h2><a id="styleguide">Style Guide</a></h2>
            <h3>Color Scheme</h3>
              <p>I chose a color scheme based on matching to the HOA's current <a href="http://cit230.darr.org/images/Silver_Oaks.jpg">logo</a>. I used the <a href="https://www.gimp.org/">GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP)</a> to match the colors.</p>
              <h4>Background</h4>
                <p>The background simply uses #ffffff</p>
                <div id="colorsample1" class="colorsamples"></div>
              <h4>Text</h4>
                <p>The text uses #000000 for legibility.</p>
                <div id="colorsample2" class="colorsamples"></div>
              <h4>Headings</h4>
                <p>The headings use #747474 for a legible silver contrast.</p>
                <div id="colorsample3" class="colorsamples"></div>
              <h4>Links</h4>
                <p>I prefer not to change link colors. It tends to confuse users on pages I have attempted that with.</p>
              <p>After looking at the colors, I think the HOA was deeply inspired by the San Antonio Spurs for the color scheme.</p>
            <h3>Typography</h3>
              <h4>Font Family</h4>
                <p>I chose Futura as the font to use through out my webpage. I looked at a list of the best looking modern fonts and this one looked nice without sticking out too much.</p>
              <h4>Sizing and Line Height</h4>
                <p>I used what was cited as average heading font size and line height according to other sources. It looked pretty good after I set it.</p>
                <p>h1 font-size: 2em, line-height: 1.25em</p>
                <p>h2 font-size: 1.5em, line-height: 1.2em</p>
                <p>h3 font-size: 1.3em, line-height: 1.15em</p>
                <p>h4 font-size: 1em, line-height: 1.10em</p>
                <p>h5 font-size: 0.8em, line-height: 1.05em</p>
                <p>h6 font-size: 0.7em, line-height: 1em</p>
            <h3>Navigation</h3>
              <p>I have already placed navigation above as a working example. I once again themedwith the silver #747474 and as a mouseover it switches to black. The navigation is aligned to the left and will stay consistent on pages. If you missed the above example, here is a screenshot of it:</p>
                <img  src="http://cit230.darr.org/images/navigation.png" alt="Navigation"/>
            <h3>Responsiveness</h3>
              <p>The following is how this website would look on a desktop, phone, and tablet:</p>
              <h4>Desktop</h4>
                <img  src="http://cit230.darr.org/images/desktop.png" alt="Desktop"/>
              <h4>Phone</h4>
                <img  src="http://cit230.darr.org/images/phone.png" alt="Phone"/>
              <h4>Tablet</h4>
                <img  src="http://cit230.darr.org/images/tablet.png" alt="Tablet"/>
