            <p>Dear Homeowner,<br><br>
                Prior to purchasing your home, you were informed of the Silver Oaks Homeowners Association and its many fine features.  The Board of Directors and the Architectural Control Authorities (ACA) would like to welcome you to our community and provide you more information about the Association's rules and regulations, services provided by outside agencies, utilities and phone numbers for your convenience.<br><br>
                Homeowners in Silver Oaks want to make it a better place to live and enhance long-term property values.  In order to do this, everyone must comply with the Declaration of Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions (DCCR's) and our ACA Design Standards, which are provided during the transaction of the purchase of your home.  Most violations occur as a result of insufficient information or misinformation.  The following information is provided to help clarify the requirements.  If you have any questions, please call the Association office at 210-829-7202.</p>
